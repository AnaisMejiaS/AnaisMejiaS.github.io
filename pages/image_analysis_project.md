# ðŸ§  Image Analysis Project: Brain Cell Counting  

{% include feature_row id="feature_row3" type="left" %}

---

In this project, we used **CellProfiler** to quantify brain cells from microscopy images. This approach allowed high-throughput, automated, and reproducible cell counting.

### âœ… **Key Analysis Steps in CellProfiler:**
- Image Preprocessing using **ColorToGray** module.
- Applied filters:  
  - **EnhanceEdges**  
  - **GaussianFilter**  
  - **ErodeImage**  
  - **Closing**
- Identified primary objects (brain cells) for quantification.
- Exported data for statistical analysis.

---

### ðŸ“Š **Example Results:**
- Total cells detected: **1,245 cells per image** (average).
- Increased cell density observed in specific brain regions under experimental conditions.
